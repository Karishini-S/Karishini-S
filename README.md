## Hi there 👋! 
I'm Karishini, a second year B.Tech student.
Passionate about Full Stack Development, AI & ML, AI in finance

## ✨About me:
Currently pursuing B.Tech in **AI & Data Science**.
My happy place is somewhere between solving backend bugs and refining UI themes
When I'm not building, I'm probably immersed in stories that spark creativity and imagination

🌱 Learning Journey: 
- Hands on with low-level hardware systems to high-level AI applications
- My journey has been a blend of algorithms and research.

💭 Currently experimenting with ways to make **personal finance** smarter, more fun and a little addictive.

Still learning, still building and always excited to grow! 🚀
